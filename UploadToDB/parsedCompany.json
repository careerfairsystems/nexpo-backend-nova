This requires changes on three critical fronts:\n\n \n\nMaintaining accurate visibility of application and network traffic\nEncryption renders most existing data collection methods ineffective. As the Internet continues to go dark, a new approach is needed to maintain a high-level of application and network intelligence, but also to ensure accurate charging and sustained profitability for highly valuable services.\n\n \n\nUnderstanding contextual application Quality of Experience\nRunning a profitable network requires a deep understanding of how critical applications, such as video, gaming, social sharing, and enterprise applications are performing. However, most service providers lack the context and the associated key performance indicators needed to truly determine application quality of experience (QoE).\n\n \n\nScaling to meet performance and volumetric requirements\nAs video shifts to HD and 4K streaming, cloud gaming grows in popularity, and new smart workplace and industry applications gain traction, bandwidth usage is exploding with little additional revenues. Meeting this challenge on the data plane requires hyper-scalable software solutions optimized to run in flexible cloud, virtual, and physical deployment models.\n\n\nSandvine\u2019s cloud-based Application and Network Intelligence portfolio and pre-packaged use cases help customers analyze, optimize, and monetize application experiences using contextual machine learning-based insights and real-time actions. Market-leading classification of more than 95% of traffic in real time across mobile and fixed networks by user, application, device, and location significantly enhances interactions between users and applications.\n\n \n\nSandvine is deployed by over 200 of the largest service providers globally, serving over 2.5 billion users in more than 100 countries. These service providers choose Sandvine on a daily basis for the following reasons:\n\n \n\nGlobal Internet Authority \nThe leading authority on the continuously evolving internet phenomena dominating global networks\n\n\nApplication and Network Intelligence-Based Solutions\nCombines unparalleled application visibility with contextual awareness to deliver complete and comprehensive solutions in key areas: Video, Gaming, Social Sharing, Enterprise Managed Services, and Internet of Things\n\n\nBest Real-Time Application and Network Data for Inline Actions\nReal-time, high-definition granularity with the industry\u2019s most accurate application classification\n\n\nSingle Pane of Glass \nSandvine\u2019s Application and Network Intelligence (ANI) Portal visualizes contextual data, and provides unique application and network QoE scoring metrics critical for improving performance\n\n\nProven Leadership for Real-Time Actions\nTrusted for over 20 years in large scale communications networks as the \u2018internal engine\u2019 for intelligent policy control and mitigation\n\n\nAnalytics-Driven Automation \nAutomation-based use cases drive decisions and actions in a closed-loop cycle, and deliver operational savings and improved efficiency to solve current and future application and network challenges",

With an earlier focus on fossil fuels, RWE has embarked on a major transition of the company towards becoming a pure renewable company. This journey was accelerated in 2021 where the \u201cGrowing Green\u201d strategy was launched, where RWE will invest 500 billion SEK in renewable technologies towards 2030. \n\nRWE Renewables is the entity of RWE driving the transition focusing on developing, constructing and operating renewable assets across a variety of technologies; offshore wind, onshore wind, solar PV, battery and hydrogen. \n\nIn the Nordic countries, RWE Renewables are running operations for more than 1 GW of onshore and offshore wind capacity. RWE Renewables has for many years been a leading player in onshore wind. We are also a front runner in offshore wind, where we are constructing Thor in Denmark, the largest offshore wind farm in the Nordic countries, and are in the late development stage of another significant offshore wind farm project in Sweden, S\u00f6dra Victoria.",

Our ambition is to have a completely carbon-neutral production by 2045. At our sugar factory in \u00d6rtofta, we are now finalizing a facility to take fossil-free energy from a nearby heating plant, which from 2022 will mean a direct reduction of fossil energy by up to 25%. A large part of our products are transported by train.\nOur sugar beet comes from around 1,000 growers in southern Sweden and our products are sold under the brands Nordic Sugar for industry and Dansukker for consumers. From the residues of sugar production we make high quality animal feed. Nordic Sugar Sweden has an attractive location in the middle of the food region Sk\u00e5ne, just outside the university city Lund, and the company offers good career opportunities.
